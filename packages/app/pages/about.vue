      <h1>About Halftone</h1>

      <p>
        We think news titles are like dots in the full pictures, a smaller component
        with so tiny imperfections that only when you get closer can see them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We treat news as piece of Arts, we plot "facts" from news paper in a canvas,
        sometimes with dots, other times with lines.
      </p>

      <p>
        We keep the nostalgia of what halftone meant for the printing revolutions,
        transfer those detail images or drawings for give a visual representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        We imbrace the imperfection, the black and white, the omission of the details.
        And we consume a partial information by avoiding to form an hopinion about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are Art.
        Art for the people.
