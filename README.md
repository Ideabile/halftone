# About
We think news titles are like dots in the full pictures, a smaller component
with so tiny imperfections that only when you get closer can see them.

We treat news as piece of Arts, we plot "facts" from news paper in a canvas,
sometimes with dots, other times with lines.

We keep the nostalgia of what halftone meant for the printing revolutions,
transfer those detail images or drawings for give a visual representation.

We imbrace the imperfection, the black and white, the omission of the details.
And we consume a partial information by avoiding to form an hopinion about it.

We are Art.
Art for the people.
